# RID*EO*
The crowded roadways need a hero!

## Description

RID*EO* Mission:

To promote all forms of ridesharing, connect communities, and provide a safe efficient service that can be used by
any and all demographics.  

At the heart of our application is a unique 'clusteringâ€™ algorithm that allows users to simply input three data points- 
(Home address, Work address, Time for use) and receive a number of carpool options to choose from.  Our goal is to 
strip away any pretense about ridesharing and connect like minded individuals that share a desire to move their community 
forward!

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that RID*EO* does well:

 - We have a carpool class that will connect users by way of calenders and common driving times:

```
class Carpool(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    driver_accepted = db.Column(db.Boolean)
    passenger_accepted = db.Column(db.Boolean)
    driver_calendar_id = db.Column(db.Integer,
                                   db.ForeignKey('calendar.id'),
                                   nullable=False)
    passenger_calendar_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('calendar.id'),
                                      nullable=False)
    vehicle_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('vehicle.id'))
    driver_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    passenger_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))

    @property
    def users(self):
        user1 = Calendar.query.filter(
            Calendar.id == self.driver_calendar_id).first().user_id
        user2 = Calendar.query.filter(
            Calendar.id == self.passenger_calendar_id).first().user_id
        return [user1, user2]

    @property
    def details(self):
        driver_arrival_time = Calendar.query.filter(
            Calendar.id == self.driver_calendar_id).first().arrival_datetime
        driver_depart_time = Calendar.query.filter(
            Calendar.id == self.driver_calendar_id).first().departure_datetime
        passenger_arrival_time = Calendar.query.filter(
            Calendar.id == self.passenger_calendar_id).first().arrival_datetime
        passenger_depart_time = Calendar.query.filter(
            Calendar.id == self.passenger_calendar_id).first().\
                departure_datetime
        driver = User.query.filter(User.id == self.driver_id).first().to_dict()
        passenger = User.query.filter(User.id == self.passenger_id).\
            first().to_dict()
        return {"driver":
                    {
                    "info": driver,
                    "arrival": driver_arrival_time,
                    "departure": driver_depart_time
                    },
                "passenger":
                    {
                    "info": passenger,
                    "arrival": passenger_arrival_time,
                    "departure": passenger_depart_time
                    }
                }

    def to_dict(self):
        return {"id": self.id,
                "driver_accepted": self.driver_accepted,
                "passenger_accepted": self.passenger_accepted,
                "driver_calendar_id": self.driver_calendar_id,
                "passenger_calendar_id": self.passenger_calendar_id,
                "vehicle_id": self.vehicle_id,
                "driver_id": self.driver_id,
                "passenger_id": self.passenger_id
                }
```
  - We have a function that searches for the best gas prices near your current carpool route:
  
```
def get_gas_prices(driver_id):
    driver = User.query.filter_by(id=driver_id).first()
    driver_lat = driver.latitude
    driver_lon = driver.longitude
    api_call_url = "http://devapi.mygasfeed.com/stations/radius/{}/{}/5/" \
               "reg/Price/{}.json".format(driver_lat, driver_lon, current_app.config["MYGASFEEDAPI"])
    request = url.urlopen(api_call_url).read().decode("utf-8")
    request = json.loads(request)
    '''request is now a dictionary'''
    stations = request["stations"]
    '''stations is a list of dicts'''
    prices = [station["reg_price"] for station in stations]
    prices = [i for i in prices if i !="N/A"]
    average_price = round(st.mean([float(price) for price in prices]), 2)
    return average_price

```
 
  - We also have a beautiful user interface with some pretty nifty uses of html/css/javascript:
  
```

```
