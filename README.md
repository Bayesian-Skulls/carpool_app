# RID*EO*
The crowded roadways need a hero!

## Description

RID*EO* Mission:

To promote all forms of ridesharing, connect communities, and provide a safe efficient service that can be used by
any and all demographics.  

At the heart of our application is a unique clustering algorithm that allows users to simply input three data points- 
(Home address, Work address, Work Schedule) and receive a personalized ridesharing opportunity to take advantage of.  Our goal is to strip away any pretense about ridesharing and connect like minded individuals that share a desire to move their community forward!

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that RID*EO* does well:

 - We have a carpool class that will connect users by way of work schedule and location:

 - We have a cool function that searches for the best gas prices near your current carpool route:

 - We also have a beautiful user interface with some pretty nifty uses of html/css/javascript:
