First, you use Facebook to register with our app, which enables you to make real connections with people in your own community. Second, setup your profile, post your work schedule along with your home and work address. Lastly, sit back and let us be the roadway hero you deserve, by letting us use our patented algorithm to choose the most efficient rideshare for you and others in your network!</p></div><div id=why class="page-section page-info-paragraph"><h3>WHY RIDESHARE?</h3><p>Why rideshare? Well, it all starts with the environmental and monetary costs of transportation. Close to 30% of the greenhouse gases released in the United States come from transportation. Each gallon of gasoline burned in a averagecar’s engine expels 19.4 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere. You are expelling 350 pounds of CO2 by the time you need to fill up your gas tank (average tank of 15 gallons).</p><p>Driving also costs money. By not driving to work one day (given an average commute of 32 miles both ways), you will save around 1.3 gallons of gas, or $3.30 each day. And once you calculate costs of maintenance, parking, tolls, and so forth- the savings will be much more.</p></div></div><footer-nav></footer-nav></div>
