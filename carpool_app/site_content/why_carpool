Ridesharing: Saving the Planet, Culture, and Society

Practically:

Why Carpool? Well, it all starts with the environmental and monetary costs of transportation. Close to 30% of the
greenhouse gases released in the United States come from transportation. Each gallon of gasoline burned in a averagecar’s engine expels 19.4 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere.  You are expelling 350 pounds of CO2 by the time you need
to fill up your gas tank (average tank of 15 gallons).

Driving also costs money.  By not driving to work one day (given an average commute of 32 miles both ways),
you will save around 1.3 gallons of gas, or $3.30 each day.  And once you calculate costs of maintenance, parking,
tolls, and so forth- the savings will be much more.


Philosophically:

We hope for a future filled with ridesharing, high-speed rail systems and mass transit abound, a future with bike paths
and trails connecting cities with its suburbs. Ridesharing is the first and easiest step towards our goal of making a
city more sustainable and productive.

Fewer cars on the road will contribute to cleaner, less congested cities, healthier people, and an added bonus of
aiding a positive shift in societal culture.  By ridesharing, we will be pulled from the solitude of our cars and
placed with different people, people from whom we can learn and interact.

While environmental reasons, city congestion, and physically healthier people are very important and should always
be a part of a ‘driving less’ conversation, we have an opportunity to get much more from simply sacrificing a little
time behind the wheel… a stronger community.
